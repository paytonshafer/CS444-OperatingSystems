# CS444-OperatingSystems
This is a collection of my homework solutions for CS444: Operating Systems at Clarkson University in spring 2023. Below I go into depth with what each
homework is and how to run the program. A code review for each homework can be found in this youtube playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMAexaDQkkbDOClG_DTMeQBDowGB1q8M1

## HW1: Matrix multiplication using pthreads
This homework required me to write a program that does matrix multlipication with pthreads. The user first enters the size of both matricies involved,
if the sizes are invalid for matix multiplication the user is asked to try again. Then both matricies are filled with random integers and the first 2 
matricies as well as their product is printed out. To run this program first download the source code then compile with the first commands and run with
the second command.
```sh
g++ -o matmult MatrixMult.cpp
./matmult
```

## HW2: Producer-Consumer Problem

## HW3: Key-Logger

## HW4: Dining Philospher's Problem
